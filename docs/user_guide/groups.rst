Basic Groups
============

Basic Groups are one of the two ways for organizing :ref:`users` in |service_name|. For :ref:`Object Permissions <permissions>`, a basic group acts as a single entity with all members of the group sharing any permissions granted to it.

Users can be members of any number of basic groups, leave the basic groups they are in or invite other users. Any member of a basic group can remove other members or delete the basic group as a whole.

As all users in a basic group are equal, basic groups may be best suited for those who want to freely share objects with their colleagues without fine-grained permissions. For a more detailed or hierarchical approach, see :ref:`projects`.

Basic groups can be part of multiple :ref:`group_categories`, which help finding the group in the group list.

.. note::
    Administrators can disable creation of basic groups by regular users.

.. note::
    Basic Groups were formerly known only as groups. The name was changed along with the renaming of :ref:`projects`.
