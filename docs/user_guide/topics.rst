Topics
======

Topics provide an overview of instruments or actions assigned to them and  allow filtering instruments and actions by topic in their respective lists.
A topic for example could represent a laboratory, actions used in one workflow, or the actions one research group uses.
Multiple topics can be assigned to one action or instrument.
Similar to object filters, users can save their topic filter selection for actions and instruments.

Similar to action types, topics can be displayed in the navbar and on the frontpage.
Administrators can create new topics.

.. note::
    An administrator might have disabled this feature (see :ref:`SAMPLEDB_DISABLE_TOPICS <miscellaneous_config>`)
