Topics
======

Actions in |service_name| can be filtered by topics to limit the displayed actions in the action list.
A topic for example could represent a laboratory, actions used in one workflow, or the actions one research group uses.
Multiple topics can be assigned to one action.
Similar to object filters users can save their topic filter selection.

Similar to action types, topics can be displayed in the navbar and on the frontpage.
Administrators can create new topics.

.. note::
    An administrator might have disabled this feature (see :ref:`SAMPLEDB_DISABLE_TOPICS <miscellaneous_config>`)
